      <h2>Projects</h2>
       <p>
        Greenpeace India's ongoing projects encompass a diverse range of environmental 
        challenges. Their efforts include forest conservation initiatives aimed at 
        preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change, along with marine 
        conservation campaigns focused on safeguarding the world's oceans and promoting 
        sustainable fishing practices.
                Advocating for climate justice, they push for equitable climate policies while lending 
        support to vulnerable communities adversely affected by the impacts of climate change. 
        Additionally, their efforts against plastic pollution emphasize the reduction of 
        single-use plastic and the promotion of circular economy solutions.
        They encourage public involvement in their endeavors, firmly believing that collective 
        action is the key to lasting transformation. By volunteering, making donations, or 
        supporting their campaigns, individuals have the power to make a tangible difference in 
        the pursuit of environmental protection and sustainable living.
